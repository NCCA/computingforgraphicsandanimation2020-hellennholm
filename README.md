# CFGA Assignment Helena Lennholm

Project Proposal:
Fluid Dynamics
A fluid solver where multiple fluids with varying properties can interact with eachother. The user would define the number of interacting fluids (1-4) (more than 2 might be too much). They would also define their individual density, viscosity and colour as well as the gravity applied to the scene. They then run the program and it calculates how these fluids would interact with one another.

Based off of the physics used for the python project from first year
